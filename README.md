Welcome to NetWerkedIn! This is an exciting project where I aim to build a social networking platform similar to LinkedIn using the power of REACT.JS, Redux and Firebase.

### Introduction
NetWerkedIn is a full-stack web application that aims to mimic the core functionality of LinkedIn, the popular professional networking platform.
With this project, I plan to create a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that enables users to create profiles, connect with other professionals, post and view job opportunities, and engage in meaningful discussions.

### Features

The following features will be included in the final version of NetWerkedIn:

* User Authentication: Allow users to sign up and log in securely using email/password or through their existing Google accounts using Firebase Authentication.

* User Profiles: Users can create, customize, and manage their professional profiles, including personal information, work experience, education, skills, and a profile picture.

* Networking: Users can connect with other professionals, send connection requests, and build their network of connections.

* Posts & Feed: Users can create and view posts, like, and comment on them, fostering meaningful discussions within the community.

* Job Listings: Companies can post job opportunities, and users can search and apply for jobs within the platform.

* Messaging: Users can communicate with their connections through a real-time messaging system.

* Notifications: Users will receive notifications about connection requests, messages, job applications, and other important events.
